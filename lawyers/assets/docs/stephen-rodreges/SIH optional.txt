6        Develop a Students Grievance Support System.

We are looking for a Students Grievance Support System. Expectations from software solution/webapp are: (1) It must be an easy access application, accesible to students, members of Student Grievance Redressal Committees, respective heads. (2) Students should be able to post complaints under different categories, Department Level, Institute/College Level and University Level. Again these categories would be subdivided among sub categories such as Admission, Finance, Examination, Lecture Timemable/Learning, Paper Re-Evealution, etc. (3) Members of Students Grievance Redressal Committee should be able to sort complains based on keywords. (4) The Portal should link students with respetive Department/Institutions/College and University Students Grievance Redressal Committees
